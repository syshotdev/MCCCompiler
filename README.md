# WARNING: This project is very incomplete.

MCCC - The Minecraft C Compiler.
A compiler that turns C code into redstone assembly.

That's the main goal for this project. Idk what else to say here

However, eventually, I want to try making my own programming language, which is outlined down below.

# MCC - Minecraft C

A compiled language much like C and Rust, but built in mind with ease of use and the 
"it just works"\* philosiphy.
\*It just works will not describe this language for a while

Features
- Familiar primitive types (bool, int, float)
- Extensive standard library with logical names (IO, Math, String)
- String manipulation with string libary
- Type implementations for clean dot syntax
- Generic types for generic type handling
- Traits for specifying generic types
- Headless functions (|x| {return x + 2;})
- Automatic inference of types
- Optional types
- Ranges
- More expressive switch statements (allows ranges)


Specific library addons
- ResizableArray
- LinkedList
- DoubleLinkedList
- HashMap
