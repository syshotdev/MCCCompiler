/*
We can successfully parse expressions like
`int i = 10 + 29 - (11 * 11);`
int i = 10 + 2 * (10 * 10);
Now, let's try a modified approach.
This code below requires: parsing expressions, parsing expressions with variables, parsing
expressions with functions (and using the function_call node), uninitialized variables.

int i = 2 * 2;
int j = i + function(i);
int k;
