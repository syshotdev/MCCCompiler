Stack-based allocations for nodes
Node array = array of node structs rather than pointers
current_<type> rather than <type>, because C compiler gets very confused
AST -> current_node

Completed:
Error handling for unexpected tokens

Nah:
Turn all "token_pointers" to an index in the array, rather than a pointer.
