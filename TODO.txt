Parse loops
Rename parse_scope to parse_block, rename print_ast to print_block
Add switch statement to print_block that prints out each type

Standardize vector_add and vector_get, either use addresses or actual objects.
Rename resize to reserve, resize sounds like it would change size rather than make capacity bigger.
vector_create(initial_capacity)
Make template thing for parser, aka <type> <name> <statement>, and it will make a node with those details

Completed:
Remove all unnecessary code
AST -> current_node
current_<type> rather than <type>, because C compiler gets very confused
Node array = array of node structs rather than pointers
Error handling for unexpected tokens

Nah:
Stack-based allocations for nodes
Turn all "token_pointers" to an index in the array, rather than a pointer.
