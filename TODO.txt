Replace any "variable" reassignment function with the expression parser
Type declarations (aka "int"), parsed from expression parser // IMPOSSIBLE: Scrapped (because it includes functions, 
I don't think those are valid in C). Other reasons that I forgot but you can try implmenting if you want.

Standardize vector_add and vector_get, either use addresses or actual objects.
Rename resize to reserve, resize sounds like it would change size rather than make capacity bigger.
vector_create(initial_capacity)
Make template thing for parser, aka <type> <name> <statement>, and it will make a node with those details

Completed:
Error function (Print filename, functionname:linenumber\n"Error: ...")
Add switch statement to print_block that prints out each type
Rename parse_scope to parse_block, rename print_ast to print_block
Parse loops
If statements
++ Postfisx operator
Fix hashmap create_or_clear bug for context hashmap
Remove all unnecessary code
AST -> current_node
current_<type> rather than <type>, because C compiler gets very confused
Node array = array of node structs rather than pointers
Error handling for unexpected tokens

Nah:
Consts EVERYWERE!
Stack-based allocations for nodes
Turn all "token_pointers" to an index in the array, rather than a pointer.
